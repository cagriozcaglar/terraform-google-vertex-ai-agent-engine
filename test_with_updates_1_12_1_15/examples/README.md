# Basic Example for an Empty Module

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Terraform module.

Since the source module is currently empty (it defines no resources, variables, or outputs), this example simply calls the module. Running this example will successfully initialize, plan, and apply, but it will not create any resources. It serves as a structural placeholder for how to call the module.

## How to use

Execute the following commands to run this example:

1.  `terraform init`
2.  `terraform plan`
3.  `terraform apply`
